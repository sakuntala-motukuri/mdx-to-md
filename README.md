This script file is designed to convert Markdown Extended (MDX) files into standard Markdown (MD) files. The process is straightforward and can be executed with just a few simple commands.

Getting Started

To begin, ensure that you have the following requirements installed on your system:

Node.js
NPM (Node Package Manager)
Installation

Clone the repository or download the script file.
Open the command line terminal and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.
Run the command "npm install" to install the required dependencies for the script.
Usage

Open the command line terminal in the directory where the MDX file is located.
Run the command "node convert.js" and provide the name of the MDX file you want to convert. For example: "node mdx-to-md.js my-mdx-file.mdx"
Once the script has finished running, the new MD file will be located in the same directory as the original MDX file.
